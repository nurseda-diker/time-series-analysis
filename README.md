## Stock Price Analysis
### :question:What is a Time Series?
A time series is a data set of observations collected at regular intervals. Time series data contains values ​​that vary depending on the date or timestamp. For example, stock prices, air temperatures or energy consumption data can be given as examples of time series. <br> <br>
Time series have three basic components:
* **Trend** : The long-term direction of the data (upward or downward)
* **Seasonality** : Repeating fluctuations over specific periods (e.g. seasonal effects)
* **Residual** :  Irregular fluctuations not explained by the trend and seasonality
